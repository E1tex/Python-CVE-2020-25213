# Python-CVE-2020-25213
Python Interactive Exploit for WP File Manager Vulnerability. The File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin before 6.9 for WordPress allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code because it renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension.

The script uses the `argparse`, `requests`, `re`, `sys`, `os`, `json`, and `random` Python modules. 

To install these modules via `pip`, execute the following command in the command line:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When this command is executed, `pip` will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the listed modules and their dependencies.

To use the script, you can provide the following arguments:

* `url` (required): The target WordPress website URL.
* `--upload-file` (optional): The file to upload to the server, if the WP File Manager is vulnerable.
* `--check` (optional): Check if the WP File Manager plugin is vulnerable.
* `--verbose` (optional): Enable verbose output.

Here are some examples of how to use the script:

To check if the WP File Manager plugin is vulnerable:

```
python exploit_wp_file_manager.py https://www.example.com --check
```

To upload a file to the server:

```
python exploit_wp_file_manager.py https://www.example.com --upload-file myfile.txt
```

To enable verbose output:

```
python exploit_wp_file_manager.py https://www.example.com --upload-file myfile.txt --verbose
```

Please note that exploiting vulnerabilities in software without permission is illegal and can have serious consequences. This script is for educational purposes only. Use it at your own risk.
